This repository contains C++ sample codes that I adopted from various sources to help instruct programming in C++ in 2021.
These samples try to help newcomers quickly find an appropriate pattern for solving their programming problems. Also they can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used.

These samples are by no means complete, nor free from deficiencies

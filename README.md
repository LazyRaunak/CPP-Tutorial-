C++ Tutorial: C++98/11/14/17/20 - Resources for C++ Beginners

This repository contains C++ sample codes that I adopted from various sources to help instruct programming in C++ in 2021.
These samples try to help newcomers quickly find an appropriate pattern for solving their programming problems. Also they can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used.

These samples are by no means complete, nor free from deficiencies

The program involves implementation of basic examples of:
	1. Abstract Class
	2. Abstract Class as Interface
	3. IOMANIP (Fill Stream Manupulators, Bool Stream Manupulators, Float Stream Manupulators, INT Stream Manupulators, Formatting streams)- used for aligning text
	4. Base Class Reference Polymorphism
	5. Concrete class
	6. Constructors and Destructors & their inheritance
	7. Copy Constructors
	8. Custom Deleters
	9. Dynamic Binding
	10. Exception Class Hierarchy
	11. Exception from functions
	12. Friend Function
	13. Functors
	14. Generic Templates
	15. Handling Multiple Exceptions
	16. Higher Order functions
	17. Iterators
	18. Operator Overloading Polymorphism
	19. Override & Final Specifier
	20. Polymorphism
	21. Reading & Writing a file.
	22. Runtime polymorphism
	23. STL Concepts - Algorithm, List, Maps, Queue, Array, Dequeue, Priority Queue, Template Classes, Vectors, Stack
	24. Smart Pointers - Unique Pointer, Weak Pointer, Shared Pointer
	25. String Stream Class
	26. Threading
	27. Singly Linked List
	28. User defined exceptions
	29. Virtual Destructors
	30. Classes & Objects
	31. Constant Class & Static Class
	32. Default Constructor
	33. Dynamic Memory Allocation
	34. Operators
	35. Passing by refrence
	36. Pointers & Constants
	37. Protected Class
	38. Recursion
	39. Shallow Copy & Deep
